title: Untangling ancestral recombination graphs to infer complex demographic scenarios
timestamp: 2024-11-12
---
A talk at [phyloseminar.org](https://phyloseminar.org),
that explains calculation and use of empirical pair and trio coalescence rate distributions from ARGs.
Demonstrates fitting of multipopulation demographic models from inferred coalescent rate distributions, including from inferred ARGs.

<!--
*The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) encodes the complete genealogical relationships among a set of recombinant DNA sequences, and is a high-dimensional sufficient statistic for many evolutionary and population genetic models. Over the past decade multiple methods have been developed to infer an ARG from phased SNPs, typically using heuristics for the sake of scalability. There are two major obstacles to the use of inferred ARGs for subsequent model-based inference; for example, to fit and evaluate complex demographic models. First, error in ARG reconstruction is inevitable and difficult to diagnose; second, the likelihood of a parameterized model given an ARG is challenging to compute even in the absence of error. We describe a statistical framework that views ARGs as collections of dated events from which simpler time-to-event distributions (coalescences of labelled pairs, trios, quartets, etc.) may be efficiently approximated via weighted empirical distribution functions. Heavily parameterized demographic models can be fit by matching the empirical and expected hazard functions of many marginal time-to-event distributions simultaneously, using standard methods from the theory of continuous-time Markov processes. More generally, we discuss projecting an empirical ARG to a flexible set of time-indexed summary statistics that are amenable to modelling while remaining robust to reconstruction error.*
