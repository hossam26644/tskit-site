This describes a new tskit-based simulator that maps genotypes to phenotypes efficiently for large numbers
of genomes. The new software, `tstrait`, takes an existing tree sequence containing mutations,
and simulates a quantitative phenotypic trait whose value is partially determined by a selected
set of causal mutations in the tree sequence. Also see the
[tskit news item](/news/20230920-tstrait-0.0.1.html) about the associated software release.
