A talk at [phyloseminar.org](https://phyloseminar.org),
that gives an overview of tskit and the related ecosystem (as of 2020).

<!--
*The tree sequence data structure is a concise encoding of whole-genome ancestry and sequence data, with a rapidly maturing software ecosystem. Tree sequences encode the genealogical history of individuals subject to recombination and gene conversion, providing an efficient means of working with phylogenetic networks and other applications with a linear sequence of correlated trees. The tskit (tree sequence toolkit) library is a comprehensive framework for navigating and manipulating tree sequences using Python and C APIs and also hosts a unified interface for efficiently calculating a growing number of summary statistics. The ecosystem developing around this central technology now includes several genome simulators, a highly-scalable method for inferring ancestry from data, tsinfer, and an efficient method for dating ancestral nodes in a tree sequence topology, tsdate. In this primer session, I will introduce tskit and the tree sequence data structure as well as use downloadable Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate the simulation of genomic datasets with msprime and the calculation of population genetic statistics with tskit.*
