This paper uses a new feature implemented in msprime to simulate genetic transmission through a known pedigree.
In this case, a human pedigree based on 4 million Canadian genealogical records was used to highlight the
multiple impacts of geography on human migration. The paper is also associated with a freely available 
[simulated whole-genome dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/7702392) of almost 1.5 million individuals.
