This paper shows that we can think about any statistic that works on
sequence data in an equivalent (and more powerful) way in terms of the
underlying trees, and that we can compute these statistics very efficiently.
Read this paper if you would like more technical details on how the
underlying data structures work and an introduction to incremental
tree sequence algorithms.
