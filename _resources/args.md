title: ARGs as tree sequences
timestamp: 2023-11-10

The `tskit` library provides a convenient way to encode and work with
ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs). This tutorial introduces the
concept of "full ARGs" in tskit, the link between these ARGs and
more simplified graphical representations, and how to use `tskit`
to work with inheritance graphs in general.
