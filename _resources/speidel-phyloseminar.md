title: Population genetics using inferred genealogies and tree sequences

A talk at [phyloseminar.org](https://phyloseminar.org),
that reviews the quickly gorwing set of tools that extract information about evolutionary past
from ARGs, focused on [Relate](https://myersgroup.github.io/relate/) and [tsinfer](https://tskit.dev/tsinfer/docs/latest).

<!--
*Inferred genealogies are a reconstruction of our shared genetic past; embedded in them is information about key evolutionary events that have shaped the genetic variation observed in present-day individuals. Stored in tree sequence format, tree-based inferences can be extremely powerful and computationally efficient, allowing for joint, genome-wide analyses of large sample sizes. This seminar will aim at giving an overview of the quickly growing set of tools that extract information about our evolutionary past from these trees. We will focus particularly on Relate and tsinfer and discuss tree-based inferences of genetic structure, demographic histories, and natural selection, among others.*
